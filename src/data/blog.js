      "No one is fatal in the eyes of God. For a person to be fated is because of his conscience and choice. God had given us the power and authority (freedom) to choose, however, He ordered us to choose well. Almost 80% of man’s calamity, disaster and suffering are the results of his reasoning, carelessness, wrong choice, compromising faith and fear.Fatalism is the root of faithless(No faith in God). In Deuteronomy 30: 19, God told the people through Moses that 'I have called heaven and earth to record this day against you; I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing therefore, choose life.' The question is why God did not end at the 'cursing' or why God did not say choose the one you want instead God ordered us to choose life? The answer is simple, God wants a good life for us.He had given us the power to choose, but it is His willing for us to choose life(good things, eternal joy). God had no pleasure in anyone’s death.He gains nothing in the perished of anyone.His will is for us to choose His way and repent from our sins.God hates the fatality(death) of all people, God wants life and eternal life for all people(2Peter 3:9, 1Timothy 2: 4). All that God wants is people run to Him and choose His ways.God had no pleasure in people’s death and suffering, but He can’t do anything about it because He had given us the power to choose life or death. He continued to admonish us to choose life all the time.Choosing life is trusting in God.So, it is up to us to choose life, joy, love, peace and He will give us the grace to pursue all.God has every power and authority to force us to choose His ways, however, he has given us freedom, the power to choose, and He supports us if we choose good or eternal life. Let us turn from our careless, wrong choice, less faith, pain, evil ways and boldly draw near to the grace throne of God so we will live and walk in the status of life, joy, prosperity, peace, love, etc. Ezekiel 18: 31, “says throw away all your transgressions, whereby you have transgressed; and I will make in you a new heart and a new spirit.In Matthew 11: 28 Jesus said, “come unto me, all who labor is heavy- burden and overburdened and I will cause you to rest. 1Peter 5: 7 also emphasizes on the same thing  'cast all your anxieties on Him.' Ezekiel 33: 15 - 16 says, 'If the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walked in the status of life, without committing iniquity, he shall live and walk -in status of life.Grace abounds you everywhere you locate, peace, love, faith, joy, purity, hope, trust, hope, humility, prosperity is your portion, that is walking in the status of life. The verse 16 continues to say none of the sins he had committed shall be mentioned into him again.What a powerful declaration of God.Let us walk boldly and draw near the throne of grace of God, that we may get mercy and find grace to help in time of need.Hebrew 4: 16. Two things involved here: May get mercy and find grace.‘May’ means there is a condition, but for the ‘Grace’ to live, it is given unto us free, Jesus Christ had paid for it already about 2000 years ago.All that we must do is to locate grace and find it through Christ Jesus. BIG QUESTION BUT SIMPLE ANSWER.One will ask what about such circumstances as; birth problem(miscarriages), situations in life(pandemic, accident, the nation’s economy) international events government policies and many more over which we have no control of them ? The answer is simple; opposing circumstances make us strong and create a firm conviction for us to overcome them for those who trust in God.God does not depend on the things in this world before He blesses His children. The breaking down of one barrier will give one greater ability and courage to move forward.Press with determination in the right direction and circumstances will be your helpers, not your hindrance.Let remember what Paul said in Romans 8: 31 “If God is with us, who can be against us” as 1Timothy 1: 7 illustrated, He gave us the spirit boldness, love and a sound mind. We are no more us, but we are like Christ, who lives in us.For the one who lived in us is greater than the whole earth, Galatians 2: 20. Christ in you, the hope of glory. As we press forward in faith and trust in God, we should also purpose in our mind that we are supported by God and His promises towards us.Below are some of God’s promises to us.(1) Jeremiah 29: 11 - He knows the thought he had for us.(2) Psalm 91: 1 - 11 – Dwelling in the secret place of the most high God. (3) Psalm 23: 1 - 6 – A good Sheperd who takes care of all his sheep at all cost (4) Isaiah 54: 16 - 17 - No weapon formed against us shall prosper. PRAYER: Lord God, I thank you for this revelation about death and fatal.As your word promises us, help us desire more grace to overcome any fatal in our life.Jesus had overcome fatality already, and He lived in us, therefore, no fatality will have dominion over us in Jesus’ name.AMEN.",

      'You’ve probably heard that “An average of two million sperms is discharged during sexual intercourse to run a race for survival.” Eventually, only one sperm is used to fertilize an egg, and the birth of a human is the result. Now, this human is reading this book.\n\nThis phenomenon is overwhelming and overpowering.Imagine millions of people running for the first time in life’s race; fans’ cheers resonate from the bleachers as one man makes it over the finish line. Emotions are running high as people congratulate the winner and ask for autographs and photos.How was he able to achieve such success? You will assume the person who has won the race will never experience poverty for the rest of his life.He may travel first class, on private jets, or in luxury vehicles. He may chance to meet with celebrities, diplomats, or presidents, invite to ceremonies, and even participate in the opening ceremonies of the World Cup.This person is lucky and blessed and will live the life that he desires.\nNot just luxury living – but he or she will be free from sufferings and stress, will live the fullness and purposeful life, will make effective use of time, and help people around him or her. He will help the universe and encourages many people. Now imagine another person who wins the same race but does not live the life he or she is meant to live after winning a race with 2 million contestants. Instead, he or she lives with regrets, pains, and probably no purpose. He or she neither help anybody nor receives help from anyone; no one benefits from his or her victory.What happened to this guy ? How could this happen ? \n\nMany people in the world today are identified with the second individual. He can be any of us; we won the race years ago, naturally acquiring various privileges after winning the race to help ourselves and the universe. The decision to access all privileges is in our hands.We have time, money, talents, opportunities, and support from people.Yet, many of us do not live life to the fullest and never helped the universe or did just a fraction of what they could have done. Sadly, most people live or die with stress and regrets.They work their whole life to the grave only to receive the medals of sorrows and pains. On their sickbeds, they realize that what was there all along is now gone – all the privileges, all the time, all the opportunities, all the incredible gifts and talents, all the people around who were not benefited from and all the money lost.\n\nCemeteries reek of treasures in human form; great singers, music composers, doctors, researchers, teachers, IT experts, biologists, lawyers, footballers, actors, actresses, engineers, authors, advocates, activists, cooks, dancers, athletes, journalist, good parents, and coaches, and more.These treasures are buried and cannot be dug up.Each day, many people rob the universe.The universe is under severe suffering because the people are not acting accordingly, – many people no longer have joy and, no meaning to life anymore.This is not the way it should be – but how and why? The purpose of this book is to answer this question. It addresses setbacks in your life that prevent you from accessing all privileges afforded to you. The setbacks explored are those that cause many individuals to waste precious days, weeks, months, years, decades, incredible gifts, talents, and inward potential. Hindrances that make it difficult for many people to support the universe to become a better place. The deterrents that cause people to waste financial resources that they have or should have and ignore the helpful people the universe placed in their lives – the people they are supposed to receive help from but never do. This book suggests straightforward and practical ways to avoid wasting these opportunities in your life, through examples and life experiences. Most importantly, this book teaches you how to avoid misusing something or not using it, which is the root of all waste.',
